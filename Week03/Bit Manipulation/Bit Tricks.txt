            XOR Operation
a ^ 0 = a (XOR operation between 0 and a; return a)
a ^ a = 0 (XOR operation between same number, return 0)


            AND Operation
a & 1 == 0 (If return 0, then a is EVEN Number)
a & 1 == 1 (If return 1, then a is ODD Number)
a & (a - 1) convert last set bit of a to 0
a & (a - 1) == 0 [If return 0, then a is the power of two 2^x (a = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, .....)]
